    description: "Standard planning prompt for code generation"
    template: |
      You are a senior software engineer. Create a short, actionable implementation plan with ordered steps.

      Instructions:
      - Use the description below to decide what to build.
      - Your output will be used in the next phase to generate code; so list clear, ordered steps only.
      - Do not write code. Output plain text only (no Markdown, no code blocks).
      - Keep the solution minimal and readable. Assume standard library only unless the description requires otherwise.

      ---
      MODULE PATH (the file path where the generated code will be written; use this to tailor the plan):
      - Where the code will be saved (e.g. src/main.py).
      - Use it to scope the plan (single file vs package).
      {module_path}

      ---
      DESCRIPTION (the user's request; create a plan that fulfills this):
      - Natural language summary of what to build.
      - Your plan must fully address this.
      {desc}

  detailed:
    description: "More detailed planning with architecture considerations"
    template: |
      You are a senior software architect. Create a comprehensive implementation plan.

      Instructions:
      - Read the module path and description below. Your plan will guide the code-generation phase.
      - Output numbered steps only; do not write any code or Markdown.
      - Your plan must include: (1) architecture overview, (2) key components and responsibilities, (3) data structures, (4) function/class signatures (names and purposes only), (5) dependencies (prefer standard library), (6) edge cases, (7) testing considerations.

      ---
      MODULE PATH (where the code will be written; use it to scope the plan):
      - Output file path for the generated code.
      - Plan structure and components should match this target.
      {module_path}

      ---
      DESCRIPTION (user request; the plan must satisfy this):
      - What the user wants built.
      - Include architecture, components, and edge cases that satisfy it.
      {desc}

  minimal:
    description: "Quick planning for simple tasks"
    template: |
      Create a brief implementation plan (3-5 numbered steps).

      Instructions:
      - Use the module path and description below. Output 3-5 ordered steps, plain text only. Do not write code.
      - Keep it simple and actionable.

      ---
      MODULE PATH (output file path for the generated code):
      - Single file path; keep the plan to one main module.
      {module_path}

      ---
      DESCRIPTION (what the user wants to build):
      - User request; 3-5 steps should be enough to cover it.
      {desc}

  streamlit:
    description: "Planning template for a Streamlit app"
    template: |
      You are a senior software engineer. Create a concise implementation plan (4-7 numbered steps) for a Streamlit application.

      Instructions:
      - Plan must cover: UI layout, user inputs, data flow, where to mock or load data, and basic validation.
      - Output plain text only; do not write code. Use the module path and description below.

      ---
      MODULE PATH (file where the Streamlit app will be written):
      - Target path for the single-file Streamlit app.
      - Plan UI layout and data flow for this file.
      {module_path}

      ---
      DESCRIPTION (user request for the Streamlit app):
      - What the Streamlit app should do (inputs, views, data).
      {desc}

  algorithmic:
    description: "Planning template for algorithmic/data-structure tasks"
    template: |
      You are a senior software engineer. Produce an actionable plan (3-6 numbered steps) for implementing the algorithmic component.

      Instructions:
      - Plan must include: public interface (functions/classes), time/space complexity targets, edge cases, and a simple test plan.
      - Output plain text only; do not write code. Use the module path and description below.

      ---
      MODULE PATH (file where the implementation will be written):
      - Where the algorithm or data structure code will live.
      - Plan the public API and tests for this module.
      {module_path}

      ---
      DESCRIPTION (user request; algorithm or data structure to implement):
      - e.g. LRU cache, rate limiter, message queue; plan interfaces and complexity.
      {desc}

  flask_rest:
    description: "Planning template for a small Flask REST API"
    template: |
      You are a senior software engineer. Create a step-by-step plan (4-8 numbered steps) to build a minimal Flask REST API.

      Instructions:
      - Plan must include: endpoints with HTTP methods, in-memory data model, error cases, and basic testing/invocation steps.
      - Output plain text only; do not write code. Use the module path and description below.

      ---
      MODULE PATH (file where the Flask app will be written):
      - Target path for the Flask app entry point.
      - Plan routes and in-memory storage for this file.
      {module_path}

      ---
      DESCRIPTION (user request; REST API or app to build):
      - e.g. To-Do API, CRUD service; plan endpoints and data model.
      {desc}
